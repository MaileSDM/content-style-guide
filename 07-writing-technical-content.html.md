At strongDM, technical content appears primarily in our [technical documentation](https://strongdm.com/docs). This section will lay out the guiding principles of technical content, discuss the main types of technical content, and outline the process of writing and editing technical articles.

## Basics

Someone reading technical content is usually looking to answer a specific question. That question might be broad in scope or it might be narrowly focused, but either way our goal is to provide answers without distraction.

For each project, consider your audience's background, goal, and current mood. Ask these questions:

- Is the reader a prospective user, a new user, or an experienced user?
- What is the goal of the user? To complete a task? To research a topic?
- Is the user in the middle of a task? Are they in a hurry? Could they be frustrated?

We do not want to overload our audience with unnecessary information, choices, or complex ideas or phrases when we do not have to. This is particularly critical when a user may be new and/or frustrated. 

When relevant, provide a brief outline of an article's focus in an introductory paragraph or section, and stick to the topic at hand. Keep sentences, paragraphs, and procedural steps focused and concise. Provide prerequisites, if necessary, to ensure that the reader is aware of what foreknowledge, software, accounts, access, or other items they may need before they waste their time reading a guide they cannot complete.

## Types of technical content

Technical content articles vary in target audience, goal, and tone depending on the task at hand and the anticipated audience for the articles.

## Guidelines

### Writing technical content

When writing technical content, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Additionally, here are some more specific pointers for writing technical content.

#### Stay relevant to the title

When a user clicks the title of an article, they expect to find inside the article more information that directly pertains to the title they clicked on. Do not stray too far from the title or topic at hand. Use links to make related content available. If you find you are getting too far from the intended topic, then you may need to create a separate but related article.

#### Keep headlines and paragraphs short and scannable

Focused users often scan an article for the part that will answer their particular question. Be sure headings are short, descriptive, and parallel, to facilitate scanning.

#### Use second person and describe actions to a user

Technical content talks to users when support agents cannot. Address the user, rather than speaking about some hypothetical third party who uses the product.

#### Strive for simplicity and clarity

Be as clear as possible. Use simple words and phrases, avoid gerunds and hard-to-translate idioms or words, focus on the specific task, limit the number of sentences per paragraph. If you must include edge cases or tangentially related information, set it aside in a note or a similar element.

#### Provide context through embedded screenshots, videos, and GIFs

Screenshots, videos, and GIFs may not be necessary for every article or process, but can be helpful to orient new users. Crop screenshots tightly around the action to focus attention. Follow image contribution rules. Ensure that images are necessary and helpful to convey a point, not superfluous and cluttered.

### Formatting technical content

Technical content uses organization, capitalization, and other formatting to help convey meaning. Although articles are organized differently, some formatting tips are consistent throughout all technical content.

#### Headings

Organize article content with H2s and H3s. Use H2s for higher-level topics or goals, and use H3s within each section for supporting information or tasks. Use sentence case for all headings other than H1 titles. Avoid the use of gerunds when starting headings where possible. As previously stated, you should be addressing the user. "Creating a gateway" is ambiguous. "Create a gateway" is an action, an instruction, and is addressed to the user.

#### Ordered Lists

Only use ordered lists for step-by-step instructions. Separate steps into logical chunks, with no more than two related actions per step. When additional explanation or a screenshot is necessary, use a line break inside the list item.

#### Unordered Lists

Use unordered lists to display examples or multiple notes. If an unordered list comprises more than 10 items, use a table instead.
