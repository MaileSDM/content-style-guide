strongDM serves international customes, not just the United States. As our user base grows, it becomes more and more important that our content is accessible to people around the world.

We call the process of writing copy for translation "internationalization." This section will address things you can do to help international audiences, including translators, better comprehend your text.

## Basics

Our Technical Content is currently only available to customers in English, but that could and likely will change in the future.

We try to write all of our content in standard, straightforward English that can be understood by users with limited English proficiency. It is also much easier for a translator to clearly communicate ideas written in straightforward, uncomplicated sentences.

Here are some guiding principles for writing for international audiences:

* **Use [active voice](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md/#header-3-active-voice).** We always aim for this, but it is especially important when writing for translation.

* **Use the subject-verb-object sentence structure.** It is not used by all languages, but it is widely recognized.

* **Use positive words when talking about positive situations.** For example, because a question like "Do not you think she did a great job?" begins with a negative word, a non-native English speaker may interpret its implication as negative. A better version would be "She did a good job, right?"

## Guidelines

When writing for international audiences, we generally follow what is outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. But in this section more than others, some style points contradict what is stated elsewhere in the guide. If you are writing something to be translated, the guidelines in this section should take precedence.

### Prioritize clarity

Keep your copy brief, but do not sacrifice clarity for brevity. You may need to repeat or add words to make the meaning of your sentences clear to a translator.

#### Repeat verbs that have multiple subjects.

  - Yes: Customers who have ordered online can pick up their food at the cashier. Walk-in customers should stop by the cashier to order their food.
  - No: Customers who have ordered online or who are walk-ins should stop at the cashier to order or pick up their food.

#### Repeat helping verbs belonging to multiple verbs

  - Yes: strongDM can manage access to your countless technical resources and can provide audit trails.
  - No: strongDM can manage access to your countless technical resources and provide audit trails.

#### Repeat subjects and verbs

  - Yes: strongDM offers centralized management without per-service credentials for each user, but most in-house solutions do not. 
  - No: strongDM offers centralized management without per-service credentials for each user, but not most in-house solutions. 

#### Repeat markers in a list or series

  - Yes: Use strongDM to manage servers, to assist with SOC II compliance, and to provide centralized access.
  - No: Use strongDM to manage servers, assist with SOC II compliance, and provide centralized access.

### Avoid ambiguity and confusion

Many words, parts of speech, and grammar mechanics we do not think twice about have the potential to cause confusion for translators and non-native English speakers. Here are some of the big trouble spots to avoid.

#### Avoid -ing words

In English, many different types of words end in -ing: nouns, adjectives, progressive verbs, etc. But a translator who is a non-native English speaker may not be able to recognize the distinctions and may try to translate them all in the same way.

Because of this, we want to avoid -ing words when possible. One exception to this rule is words like "graphing calculator" and "riding lawnmower", where the -ing word is part of a noun's name and cannot be worked around.

Here are some other cases where you might see -ing words, and suggestions for how to edit around them.

#### Gerunds

 - Yes: In this article we will talk about the creation of datasources.
 - No: In this article we will talk about creating datasources.

#### Adjectives

 - Yes: At the top of the page, there is an emoji with a smile on its face.
 - No: At the top of the page, there is a smiling emoji.

#### Parts of verbs

 - Yes: Several developers are currently working on that feature.
 - No: Several developers are working on that feature. (When you cannot easily avoid the -ing word, it may help to add an adverb to clarify the meaning.)

#### Parts of phrases modifying nouns

 - Yes: From our backyard, we could hear the planes that took off from the airport.
 - No: From our backyard, we could hear the planes taking off from the airport.

#### Other words and mechanics to avoid

* Slang, idioms, and cliches
* Shortened words, even if they're common in English (use "application," not "app")
* Uncommon foreign words (use "genuine," not "bona fide")
* Unnecessary abbreviations (use "for example," not "e.g.")
* Converting one part of speech into another if it is not already commonly used (use "Send us an email" instead of "message us")
* Non-standard or indirect verb usage (use "he says," not "he's like" or "he was all")
* Double negatives
* Synonyms, generally. Do not use a lot of different words for the same thing in a single piece of writing. Instead of mixing it up with "campaign," "newsletter," "bulletin," etc., pick one term and stick with it.

### Beware words with multiple meanings

* **"Once"** (could mean "one time," "after," "in the past," or "when")
* **"Right"** (could mean "correct," "the opposite of left," "politically conservative," etc.)
* **"Since"** (could refer to a point in time, or a synonym of "because")
* **"Require" plus an infinitive** (could confuse the relationship between subject and object)
* **"Has" or "have" plus past participle** (could confuse the relationship between subject and object)
