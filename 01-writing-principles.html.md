With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:

* **Empower.** Help people understand strongDM by using language that informs them and encourages them to make the most of our products.

* **Respect.** Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and do not patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Do not market at people; communicate with them.

* **Educate.** Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Remember that you are the expert, and readers do not have access to everything you know.

* **Guide.** Think of yourself as a tour guide for our readers. Whether you are leading them through our educational materials or a task in our app, communicate in a friendly and helpful way.

* **Speak truth.** Understand strongDM's place in our users' lives. Avoid dramatic storytelling and grandiose claims. Focus on our real strengths.

In order to achieve those goals, we make sure our content is:

* **Clear.** Understand the topic you are writing about. Use simple words and sentences.

* **Useful.** Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?

* **Friendly.** Write like a human. Do not be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from splashy homepage copy to system alerts, should be warm and human.

* **Appropriate.** Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you are writing to and what you are writing about.
