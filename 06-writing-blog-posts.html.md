strongDM blog posts are written by people from all over the company, not just those with "writer" in their job titles. We love having experts from around the office blog about their work. The person most familiar with the subject is in the best position to convey it.

## Basics

We generally publish:

* Feature, release, and integration announcements
* strongDM user case studies
* Tips and tricks for businesses regarding DevOps

We publish blog posts that explain the "why" behind the work we do. We want to show people that we're an industry leader with the best products, and we use our blog to tell the stories behind those products.

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart

This is not a term paper, nor is it an API reference. There is no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Be specific

If you are writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you are writing about a strongDM user, give the reader plenty of information about the company's stage, workflow, results, and values.

### Get to the point

Get to the important stuff right away, and do not bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up

Feel free to link away from strongDM if it helps you explain something.

### Make 'em LOL

strongDM is a fun company, and we want our blog to reflect this. Blogs are often one of the most relaxed forms of written content. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there, or link out to a funny GIF or YouTube video when appropriate. Just do not overdo it.

### Use pictures

Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you are explaining how to use strongDM, include screenshots to illustrate your point. Make sure to use alt text.
