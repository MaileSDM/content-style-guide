  <h1>strongDM Content Style Guide</h1>
  <p class="sub-h1">
    This style guide is for strongDM documentation, as well as other strongDM written materials.  Please use it as a reference when you are writing for strongDM.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-h1">
    This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It is not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.  It helps us to write clear and consistent content.
  </p>
  <p class="sub-h1">
    We've divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order.
