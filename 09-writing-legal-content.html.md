strongDM publishes many kinds of legal content to protect ourselves and our users around the world. This section gives a general overview of the types of legal content we publish and how those documents are written.

For information about laws that apply to non-legal content, see the [Copyright and trademark](/15-copyright-and-trademarks.html.md) section.

## Basics

The way we write, review, and publish legal content is different than how we do many other kinds of writing.

But that doesn't mean legal content has to be difficult to read. We try to present our legal information in the most pleasant way possible. Our goals for legal content are:

* **Accuracy.** Our first and foremost concern is that we present the correct information in a truthful way.
* **Clarity.** We try to avoid legal jargon and overly formal wording. Our users need to understand the agreement they're making with us.
* **Succinctness.** We want our users to read and understand our legal documents, while also respecting their time.

## Types of legal content

We publish several types of legal documents, each with their own writing processes and goals.

## Guidelines

When writing legal content, generally follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general considerations, too.

#### Start with the facts

We have some standard language that we use for common issues or requests, but since legal content is so fact-specific, we start there before getting into structure and format. That's why you will not see many templates for our legal content.

#### Use plain language

Legal content is serious business, so the tone is slightly more formal than most of our content. That said, we want all of our users to be able to understand our legal content. So whenever possible, we use plain language rather than legal jargon.

Instead of: "If an individual purports, and has the legal authority, to sign these Terms of Use electronically on behalf of an employer or client then that individual represents and warrants that they have full authority to bind the entity herein to the terms of this hereof agreement."

We say: "If you sign up on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf."

There are some legal terms we have to include because either there is not a sufficient plain language alternative, or case law or statute dictates that term has to be used for the contract to hold up in court. For example, sometimes we need to say "represent and warrant" instead of "confirm" or "agree". If we use those terms, we can provide an example or quick definition to help people understand what they're reading. We cannot avoid all legal terminology, but we can pare it down to what's necessary.

Some companies have complicated terms and write plain-language summaries so people can understand the agreement. We do not summarize our legal content, but instead try to write the terms themselves in plain language. We use a sidebar to provide examples or links to further reading for people who want more context.

#### Never offer legal advice

While we want to inform our users about legal issues related to their use of strongDM, we cannot offer them legal advice.
