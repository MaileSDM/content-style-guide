> Specific people do not come up often in the documentation world, but we are writers, who write content and represent a company, and it is a good thing to be aware of how to refer to people when and if the need arises, in or out of the docs.

We write the same way we build apps: with a person-first perspective. Whether you are writing for an internal or external audience, it is important to write for and about other people in a way that is compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make strongDM a better place to work and a better steward of our values in the world. In this section we will lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources for further learning.

### As part of an audience

- Do not capitalize "audience" unless it is grammatically necessary.
- Do not refer to an audience as "it". Audiences are made up of real people, so always use "they".
- This goes for contacts, too. Contacts are real people, never pieces of data.  

### Age

Do not reference a person's age unless it is relevant to what you are writing. If it *is* relevant, include the person's specific age, offset by commas.

- The CEO, 16, just got her driver's license.

Do not refer to people using age-related descriptors like "young", "old", or "elderly".

### Disability

Avoid disability-related idioms like "lame" or "falling on deaf ears." Do not refer to a person's disability unless it is relevant to what you are writing. If you need to mention it, when possible, ask whether your subject prefers person-first language ("they have a disability") or identity-first language ("they are disabled").

When writing about a person with disabilities, do not use the words "suffer", "victim", or "handicapped".

### Gender and sexuality

Do not call any groups of people "guys". Do not call women "girls".

Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like "server" instead of "waitress" and "businessperson" instead of "businessman."

It is OK to use "they" as a singular pronoun.

Use the following words as modifiers, but never as nouns:

- lesbian
- gay
- bisexual
- transgender (never "transgendered")
- trans
- queer
- LGBT

Do not use these words in reference to LGBT people or communities:

- homosexual
- lifestyle
- preference

Do not use "same-sex" marriage, unless the distinction is relevant to what you are writing, and never use "gay marriage". In most cases, it is just "marriage" without the need for distinction.

When writing about a person, use their communicated pronouns. When in doubt, just ask or use their name.

### Hearing

Use "deaf" as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use "partially deaf" or "hard of hearing".

### Heritage and nationality

Do not use hyphens when referring to someone with dual heritage or nationality. For example, use "Asian American" instead of "Asian-American".

### Medical conditions

Do not refer to a person's medical condition unless it is relevant to what you are writing.

If a reference to a person's medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Do not call a person with a medical condition a "victim".

### Mental and cognitive conditions

Do not refer to a person's mental or cognitive condition unless it is relevant to what you are writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.

Do not describe a person as "mentally ill". If a reference to a person's mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.

### Vision

Use the adjective "blind" to describe a person who is unable to see. Use "low vision" to describe a person with limited vision.
