# CONTRIBUTING GUIDE

This contributing guide is a short style and layout guide for contributors to the documentation, acting as a summarized set of rules for contributing to the documentation.

## Capitalization

* The starting "s" of "strongDM" should never be capitalized, even at the start of a sentence. When sentences can be rearranged to start with another word, that is the most ideal situation to avoid both mis-branding and the appearance of incorrect capitalization.
* The names of product features are usually capitalized when referring to the strongDM feature, but not when they refer to something more general. For instance, the term "Admin UI": `The Admin UI provides a way for strongDM users to...` vs `...many SaaS products provide some sort of admin UI to manage...`.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are formatted with triple backticks and the language:

```
    ```bash
    Stuff goes here
    And here
    ```

```
    ```javascript
    More stuff here
    And here
    ```

If using a code block inside a list, be sure to indent it four spaces beyond the current item.

1. List item discussing this code

    ```bash
    Stuff goes here
    And here
    ```

1. Other list item
1. Other list item with more items under it
   1. Sub item
   1. Sub item with code block

        ```javascript
        More stuff here
        And here
        ```

    1. Another sub item

## Front Matter

* `title` = Title of the document. H1 generated from this, sidebar title, page meta title (if nothing else specified).
* `draft` = Page is not displayed in nav, search. Page 404s when directly navigated to.
* `hidden` = Page is not displayed in nav, search. Page loads correctly when directly navigated to.

## Headings

* H1 tags should be in title case, but they are auto generated by our static site generator, so there should be no H1 tags in the raw markdown.
* H2 tags should be in title case
* All other heading levels should be in sentence case.
* Headings contain no symbols and little to no punctuation.
* Headings should not begin with gerunds (i.e. "Adding a Widget" should be "Add a Widget").

## Images

Image formatting is thus:

`![Alt Text Here](../../_images/imageyouwant.png)`

* All images need alt text
* All images are kept in the `_images` folder in the `content` folder of the repository.
* All images should be under 1200px maximum width. If we need to show something bigger, we should link the image to a full width image file rather than displaying it inline in the page.
* Images should focus on whatever the main feature they're showing is, and be cropped to wherever makes sense to that end. If the image has a white background in it, border the image with a pixel of black if possible to set it off from the white docs page.
* All images should be run through TinyPNG before being uploaded, and be a reasonable maximum width.

## Punctuation

* Contractions should be used naturally, when they make organic sense in the flow of the document.
* The strongDM docs should always use the Oxford Comma.

## UI Elements

Boogi allows the use of "admonitions" such as `<Info>`, `<Warning>` etc. These two are the two most often used in the strongDM docs. Formatting should be as follows:

```
<Info>

Test note to share with the reader.
</Info>
```

They should have newlines above and below them, as well as just after the opening tag. The closing tag should be on its own line. Info blocks are general additional information or a note that pertains to the topic, but is extraneous or to be set apart in some way. Warnings are similar, but topics that demand attention, such as to prevent errors or complications for the user.
